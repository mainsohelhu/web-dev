            <p class="box box1">Michael has been playing since the launch of Global Offensive. He rose to prominence
                through the popularity of his stream, in which he was displaying his talent in-game. After his time in
                Manajuma', he was acquired by compLexity Gaming as a stand-in, replacing Todd "anger" Williams. Upon

                compLexity being acquired by Cloud9 on August 1st,       2014, he was signed as a permanent player. He was the
                second longest standing member of the team alongside Jordan "n0thing" Gilbert until they were both
                benched and replaced by William "RUSH" Wierzba  and Tarik "tarik" Celik in August of 2017. It was announced that he stepped down from the
                lineup, as he wanted to become a backup player and full-time streamer for Cloud9, although at this point
                he had already decided to retire from the game. In April of 2018, he had officially announced his
                retirement from playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive professionally. [1] In addition to this, he
                decided to leave Cloud9 to explore new opportunities.</p>
                
                <p class="box box2">Grzesiek started his Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) career with several ESEA
                    teams, particularly Exertus eSports and Manajuma. He was soon signed by compLexity Gaming as a stand-in,
                    and later by Cloud9 in August 2014 when they acquired compLexity's roster.[6] He helped lead Cloud9 to a
                first-place finish at ESL Pro League Season 4 in 2016.[3] He stepped down from the starting roster in
                2017 to move to full-time streaming for Cloud9.[7] "shroud - Statistics". Twitch Tracker. Archived from

            <p class="box box3">On April 18, 2018, Grzesiek left Cloud9 and officially retired from professional
                CS:GO.[3]

                On March 10, 2019, Grzesiek reached 100,000 Twitch subscribers, gaining another 14,000 the next day,
                making his subscriber count more than double the streamer with the second most at the
                time—TimTheTatman.[8] He continued to stream full-time on Twitch until October 2019, when he announced
                his move from Twitch to Microsoft streaming platform Mixer. He would be broadcasting exclusively on
                Mixer, following the steps of fellow streamer Tyler "Ninja" Blevins, who announced a similar deal
                earlier that year.[9] At The Game Awards 2019 won Content Creator of the Year.[10]

                On June 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that it would be shutting down Mixer and instead partner with
                Facebook Gaming. It was alleged that Grzesiek received an offer from Facebook that would have
                financially exceeded that of Mixer. Grzesiek declined the offer and received the remainder of the
                current contract payout.[11]

                On August 11, 2020, Grzesiek announced that he would return to stream exclusively on Twitch.[12] His
                first stream back the following day peaked at over 516,000 concurrent viewers.[13][14]

                At the inaugural edition of The Streamer Awards in 2022, Grzesiek won Gamer of the Year and was
                nominated for Best FPS streamer.[15] At the February 2024 Streamer Awards, he was nominated for Gamer of
                the Year.[16] At the December 2024 Streamer Awards, Grzesiek won the Legacy Award and was nominated for
                Best FPS Streamer.[17][18]

                Valorant
                On July 8, 2022, Grzesiek signed with Sentinels as a player for their Valorant team for the North
                American Last Chance Qualifier for the 2022 Valorant Champions tournament.[7] His opening match against
                The Guard, a 2-1 loss, had over 600,000 peak viewers, setting the record for a non-international level
                match that was only surpassed in March 2024.[19][20] In the lower bracket, they eliminated Shopify
                Rebellion and were eliminated by 100 Thieves, who defeated The Guard in the LCQ finals.[21]

                Game development
                In 2022 Grzesiek partnered with Mountaintop Studios with an initial investment to create 'Spectre
                Divide' as Lead Advisor and Investor. On February 25, 2025 the first season of the video game released
                [22] and while the all-time peak on Steam was 26,232 players, the studio chose to shutdown the game due
                to "performance" and it will end on April 12, 2025.[23] CEO of Mountaintop Studios, Nate Mitchell stated
                "most of the funds of the video game was spent on getting the console release done for Season 1, the
                budget was consumed earlier than they forecasted."[24]

                Personal life
                Born in Toronto, Canada with Polish heritage, he has been living in the United States for several years.
                In 2021 he purchased a $9.4 million house in Los Angeles where he currently lives with his girlfriend,
                Hannah Kennedy, aka Bnans.[25]</p>
